<strong>BACKSTORY</strong>

This project was inspired by the "Movie Seat Booking" project in this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/learn/lecture/17842006#overview" target="_blank">Vanilla JavaScript Course.</a> I further learned about how HTML and JavaScript communicate with each other.

<strong>PROJECT JOURNEY INSIGHTS</strong>

While doing this project, I saw how JavaScript and CSS work with each other. I also saw how values set in HTML can be interacted with using JavaScript functions. The functions in this project was more understandable since they were similar to math equations (ex. let ticketPrice = +movieSelect.value).

<strong>APP OVERVIEW</strong>

1. Movie Selector

   The purple bar with white text on this web app is used to select the desired movie. Prices will change for each movie due to a "value" attribute added to each movie.

2. Seats

   Contains many empty seats, with some seats pre-filled, including occupied seats (in white) and closed seats (in pink). Selected seats (in teal) can be toggled by clicking on an empty seat and will remain as "selected", even if the user refreshes the page.

3. Seats Selected Text

   Text reminding the user of how many seats they have selected, and how much the seats are, with the quantity of seats selected and the total costs colored teal.

<strong>TECHNOLOGIES USED</strong>

JavaScript

HTML

CSS

<strong>CHALLENGES</strong>

Time Management: Keeping app development within 1 week scope - I spent 3 weeks on this project.

Going Ahead of Myself: I introduced the "Closed due to COVID-19" seats into my project too early, causing time-consuming confusion when I tried to figure out why the Seats Selected Text was not showing total prices when seats were selected.

<strong>FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS</strong>

Spaces: Watch out for missing or extra spaces that can make my code not function as intended
